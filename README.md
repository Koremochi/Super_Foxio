# Super_Foxio
 I made this as part of an assignment, during our "2D week" on the Unity education course at Incubator Pismo in Novska. 
 
 This was my first attempt at making a 2D project by myself. It's just a basic Super Mario Bros level with a few enemies and collectibles. 
 
 The code I did for it is posted here.
